## 💡 Pro Tips

### Redis is Optional
If Redis fails, your app automatically uses database fallback. Zero downtime!

### Monitor Redis
```bash
# Check cache stats
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/admin/sync-status
```

### Clear Cache
```bash
# If needed
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/admin/cache/clear
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Redis not connecting?**
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Look for:
✅ Redis connected
```

**App using database fallback?**
That's normal! It means Redis isn't available, but app still works.

To enable Redis:
1. Ensure Redis service exists in Railway
2. Restart app: `railway up --detach`
