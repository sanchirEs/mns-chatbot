## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to Railway, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Expected:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "cache": "redis",  ← Should say "redis"!
  "cacheKeys": 4,
  "products": 112
}

# 2. Test search
curl "https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/search?q=vitamin"

# 3. Check logs
railway logs

# Look for:
✅ Redis connected and ready
✅ Cache enabled (Redis)
```
