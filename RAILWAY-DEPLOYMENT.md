# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide with Redis

Complete guide to deploy your AI Pharmacy Chatbot on Railway with Redis caching.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository with your code
- Supabase project already configured

## ⚙️ Required Configuration Files

Your project now includes these Railway configuration files:
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway build and deploy configuration
- ✅ `Procfile` - Backup start command specification
- ✅ `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification (v18)

These files are already committed and tell Railway exactly how to build and run your app.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create New Project on Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub
5. Select your chatbot repository

### Step 2: Add Redis Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"New"** → **"Database"** → **"Add Redis"**
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for Redis to provision
4. Railway automatically creates `REDIS_URL` environment variable

**✅ Redis is now ready!** Railway handles all configuration automatically.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project, go to **Variables** tab and add:

```env
# Required - Core Services
NODE_ENV=production
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long

# Required - Features
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true
GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS=true

# Redis (automatically provided by Railway)
# REDIS_URL=redis://... (Railway sets this automatically)

# Optional - Fine Tuning
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
SEARCH_DEFAULT_LIMIT=5
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.5
```

**💡 Important:** Railway automatically sets `REDIS_URL` when you add the Redis database. Your app will detect this and enable Redis caching automatically!

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically deploy on git push
2. Or manually click **"Deploy"** in the Railway dashboard
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build and deployment

### Step 5: Run Initial Data Sync

After deployment, run the migration command:

**Option A: Using Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run migration
railway run npm run migrate
```

**Option B: Using Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to your service → **"Settings"** → **"Deploy"**
2. Under "Custom Start Command", temporarily set:
   ```
   npm run migrate && npm start
   ```
3. Redeploy
4. After sync completes, change back to: `npm start`

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Get your Railway URL (shown in dashboard)
RAILWAY_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Test health
curl $RAILWAY_URL/health

# Test search
curl "$RAILWAY_URL/api/search?q=vitamin"

# Check sync status
curl "$RAILWAY_URL/api/admin/sync-status"
```

## 🔍 Redis Connection Details

### How It Works

Your app automatically detects Railway's Redis:

1. Railway provides `REDIS_URL` environment variable
2. Your config (`src/config/environment.js`) detects this
3. Redis is auto-enabled when `REDIS_URL` exists
4. Connection format: `redis://default:password@redis.railway.internal:6379`

### Verify Redis Connection

Check your Railway logs for:
```
✅ Redis connected
✅ Cache enabled (Redis)
```

---

## 📊 Railway Project Structure

After setup, your Railway project will have:

```
📦 Your Project
├── 🚀 chatbot-service (Node.js app)
│   ├── Environment Variables
│   ├── Custom Domain (optional)
│   └── Logs
└── 🔴 redis-service (Redis database)
    ├── REDIS_URL (auto-configured)
    └── Metrics
```

---

## ⚙️ Redis Configuration Options

### Default (Recommended)
Railway handles everything automatically. No additional config needed!

### Custom Configuration (Optional)

If you need custom Redis settings, add to Railway variables:

```env
# Optional Redis customization
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=pharmacy:
REDIS_CACHE_TTL=300
REDIS_DB=0
```

### Disable Redis (Fallback to DB)

If you want to disable Redis:
```env
ENABLE_REDIS=false
```

The app will use PostgreSQL for caching instead.

---

## 🔧 Advanced: Redis Monitoring

### Check Redis Stats

Add this endpoint to your app (already included):
```bash
curl $RAILWAY_URL/api/admin/cache-stats
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "keys": 142,
  "usedMemoryMB": "2.34",
  "hitRate": "87%"
}
```

### Railway Redis Metrics

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on **Redis service**
2. View **Metrics** tab
3. See: Memory usage, connections, operations/sec

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Error creating build plan with Railpack"

**Problem:** Railway fails during the build phase with this error.

**Cause:** Missing Railway configuration files or unclear build instructions.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure these files exist in your repo:
   - `railway.json` ✅ (now included)
   - `Procfile` ✅ (now included)
   - `.nvmrc` ✅ (now included)

2. Commit and push these files:
   ```bash
   git add railway.json Procfile .nvmrc RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT.md
   git commit -m "Add Railway configuration files"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Railway will automatically redeploy after push
4. Check build logs in Railway dashboard

**If still failing:**
- Verify `package.json` has correct scripts:
  - `"start": "node src/app.js"` ✅
  - `"type": "module"` ✅
- Check Railway build logs for specific errors
- Ensure Node.js v18 is being used

### Redis Connection Failed

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Look for:**
```
⚠️ Redis connection failed - using database fallback
```

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure Redis service is running in Railway dashboard
2. Check `REDIS_URL` exists in environment variables
3. Restart app: `railway up --detach`

### Sync Not Running

**Verify scheduler is enabled:**
```env
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true
```

**Check logs for:**
```
📅 Starting sync scheduler...
✅ Sync scheduler started
```

### High Memory Usage

**Optimize Redis:**
```env
# Reduce cache TTL (default 5 min → 2 min)
REDIS_CACHE_TTL=120

# Clear cache manually
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/admin/cache/clear
```

---
